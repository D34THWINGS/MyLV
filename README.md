Timesheets editor, vacations manager and transport receipts upload for LinkValue built with React, Redux and HapiJS.
The objective of this project is to be able to fill out your timesheets/vacations within 10 seconds without effort.

## Installation

Before anything, be sure to have Node 10.14.x at least installed.
Also MongoDB >3.6.x is required if you don't use Docker.

If you don't want to use production authentication service ([LinkValue](https://lvconnect.link-value.fr))
create a local configuration file under `config/local.{js,json}` containing the following fields:

```json
{
  "lvconnect": {
    "appId": "LvConnect app id used for login",
    "appSecret": "LvConnect app secret used for login"
  }
}
```

This file can override any fields contained in other configuration files. More information about configuration
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config).

Next, you'll have to install the dependencies by running:

```
yarn
```

To build the frontend application for production use, you'll have to run:

```
yarn dist
```

Finally, to start the application in production environment:

```
NODE_ENV=production node .
```

## Development

You can run the server and its database in a docker by running :

```
docker-compose up
```

Note : You will need to update/create the configuration file `config/local.js` to run node on correct host.

```
module.exports = {
  host: {
    hostname: '0.0.0.0',
  },
  lvconnect: {
    appId: '731c8e87-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx',
    appSecret: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    endpoint: 'https://lvconnect.link-value.fr', // use lvconnect prod
  },
  mongodb: {
    host: 'db', // http://db is the docker address in the default network
    port: 27017,
    database: 'cracra',
    config: {
      useMongoClient: true,
    },
  },
}
```



## Contributing

This project uses ESLint to check code style and uses the AirBnB configuration without semicolons.
We recommend the usage of a plugin for your IDE to enable lint inside it. At this moment the project is lacking unit
testing and feature testing which opens a window for regressions so be careful.

To start the frontend watch mode build, run:

```
yarn dev:front
```

And for the backend watch mode, run:

```
yarn dev:back
```
