CRA editor for LinkValue built with React, Redux and [SaguiJS](https://github.com/saguijs/sagui) (Webpack, Babel, Eslint, SCSS).
The objective of this project is to be able to fill out your CRA within 10 seconds without effort.

## Contributing

Before anything, be sure to have Node 6.9.x at least installed.
To contribute to this project, clone the project then run in the root folder of the project:

```
npm install
```

Then run for development:

```
npm start
```

Or for dist build:

```
npm run dist
```

This project uses ESLint to check code style and uses the default configuration from SaguiJS which is semicolon free.
We recommend the usage of a plugin for your IDE to enable lint inside it. At this moment the project is lacking unit
testing and feature testing which opens a window for regressions so be careful.
